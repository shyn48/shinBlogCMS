# shinBlogCMS
A rather simple blog with a content management system and an admin panel

At this moment, this is front-end only and in order to load up the dependencies you should:

```
npm install

```

After npm finished installing node_modules you can run the server using:

```
npms start

```

These steps may change after the back-end is up and running so stay tuned for updates.
